I was talking to clones on the phone
There were three of them
Parking in tandem
Instant adoption
There was mold in the walls
And I'm getting cold calls
From doctors and lawyers
Who say I've evolved
I can't take it
I always fake it
Got an Adderall prescription
To help me to make it

A ticket to Mars in a two seater car
Reading Harper's Bazaar

D-D-D-D-D-Dementia
Dementia, dementia
D-D-D-D-D-Dementia
Dementia

Silicon, laxatives
Women at war
Woke up from a dream
I was Eleanor Roosevelt
There's nothing that I have felt
There's nothing I need
Flying on an airplane
Looking for some speed

And it's Esquire Magazine
Vampires and zombies
Vultures and hawks

D-D-D-D-D-Dementia
Dementia, dementia
D-D-D-D-D-Dementia
Dementia

It made me everything I wanted to be
Oh baby, please
ABC Television Broadcasting
Out to the world

Scientific American
Is putting the scare in them
I know who you are
I know who you are

Dementia
And I'm so glad that I met ya
Dementia
So glad that I met ya
Dementia
So glad that I met ya
Dementia
Meet my friend, Dementia
