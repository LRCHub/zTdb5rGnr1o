Well, they told her she could really
Be her own woman now
Get her an apartment
On the partyin' side of town

But they didn't tell her what to do
When the alimony's late
Or when the baby gets sick
Or when you're losin'
Your good blind date

Yeah, she thought the man
Would fall out her heat
When she was single again
But after workin' dirty diapers
She's just ready to turn it in

She knows that things
Have got to get better than this
And she knows it's pretty bad
When she starts missing
That marital bliss

She's just a d, d, d, divorce
Yeah, she's got her walkin' papers
On her third anniversary
She's got bills and a baby
But at least she's single and free
She's just a d, d, d, divorce

Well, her mama said
She should've tried
To make that marriage work
But mama didn't have to live
With that drunken jerk

Now, she's got a second job
As a waitress in a local jive
Guess she can put up
With the tips and the nerds
She just might survive

She's just a d, d, d, d, divorce
Yeah, she's got her walkin' papers
On her third anniversary
She's got bills and a baby
But at least she's single and free
She's just a d, d, d, divorce

Well, she lies there at night
Dreams of her prince charmin'
Well, he's a rich and handsome
No trouble with his head

When that sun comes up
And reality is alarmin'
And all that shit
When she finds Mr. Perfect
Will he want another man's kid?

D, d, d, d, divorce
Yeah, she's got her walkin' papers
On her third anniversary
She's got bills and a baby
But at least she's single and free
She's just a d, d, d, divorce

She's just a d, d, d, divorce
